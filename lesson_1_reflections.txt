How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It removed all the matching items so it was easier to see the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps you to know what was changed over time so if something needs to come back its easier to find.
	It also helps you find where bugs were potentially introduced and by whom so they can learn from 
	their mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It keeps your history log smaller and only reflects completed changes instead of half done changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Often a single feature or bug requires multiple files to be updated at once,
	allowing the ability to commit multiple files at once saves time.  
	Google Docs on the other hand treats each file separately as that is how those
	files are most often updated

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can use git log to view all the commits and you can use git diff to view the changes between
	two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control allows you to go back to a working version if you happen to break something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making edits and committing
